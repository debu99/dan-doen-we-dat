# DOCS
The Documentation of Social Engine is limited. You can find it [here](https://www.socialengine.com/support/article/5145264/) socialengine-php-overview. Social engine is relying on the first version (1.12) of the Zend Framework, of which the documentation is more extensive and can be found [here](https://framework.zend.com/apidoc/1.12/index.html). The rest of these docs has a goal to explain how to run this project and fill in the gaps that the documention of SE leaves. Feel free to edit it with new findings.

If you are new to this project, you probably want to start with "How to Run Locally".
