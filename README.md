## DOCS
The Documentation of Social Engine is limited. You can find it here: https://www.socialengine.com/support/article/5145264/socialengine-php-overview. Social engine is relying on the first version (1.12) of the Zend Framework, of which the documentation is more extensive and can be found here: Zend framwork 1 reference: https://framework.zend.com/apidoc/1.12/index.html. The rest of these docs has a goal to explain how to run this project. Feel free to edit it with new findings.

If you are new to this project, you probably want to start with "How to Run Locally".
