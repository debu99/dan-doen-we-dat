## Access
There are different kinds of users who can be onboarded. A prospect developer needs the least amount of access, followed by a fully regular developer. Only an admin user has full access to github, AWS and other tools. Ahmd Tarsi is the owner of the project and always should have admin privileges. As of current writing, Jurgen Tonneyck is the main developer and has admin privileges too. If you needs extra permissions, first contact the main developer and if not available, ask Ahmed.
## Prospect Developer
A prospect developer should only have read access to Github and Docker hub. The current free version of docker hub only always 1 admin user. It's advisable to go for the payed plan if budget allows it.
